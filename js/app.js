//Verbal questions
//1. a parameter is defined in the function and describes what
//the argument will be inputed by the user and will be evaluated
//by the function

//2. a console log is simply a debugging tool that doesn't 
//accomplish anything; return actually "returns" us a value,
//it's the output of a function

//3. the implications of the ability of a function to return
//a value is that a user is able to input a value on the front
//end, the function will evaluate it based on the block of code
//it's programmed to run, and then the user will actually SEE
//the result. furthermore, the result can then be redefined into
//a new variable that can be used elsewhere
